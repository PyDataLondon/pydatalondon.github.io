## Speaking at PyData London Meetups

Have you been working on an interesting project that you want to show off to
fellow members? Found a really cool library that you want everyone to know
about? Whether it's a half-hour slot or a 5-minute lightning talk, get in touch
and let's get you on the stage! 

There's a few details to note:
* We have 2 longer talks - 25 mins talk time & 5 mins Q&A
* We have 2 or so 5 minute talks
* All talks are timed, the lightning talks have a hard 5 minute limit, we have
  a hard exit time on the venue so please make sure you'll run to time
  (under-running is fine!)
* Check the NumFOCUS [Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct) -
  all language and imagery must be inclusionary, in particular try to avoid
  gendered reference (e.g. prefer something like 'folks' over 'guys')
* No product pitches - we're strict about this - these aren't sales slots and
  the room is not populated by buyers
* Your talk should educate, you're welcome to note 'we're hiring' or similar
  during your talk (that's a sensible quid-pro-quo for your company letting you
  write your talk whilst at work)
* We usually schedule talks a few months in advance. If you're only available
  for a specific date please let us know and we'll try to accommodate.
