# PyData London

## PyData London Conference 2017

We are pleased to announce that the Pydata London Conference will be held over the weekend of 5-7 May. For more details, please head over to our [conference website](http://pydata.org/london2017/). We are currently looking for volunteers who can help with logistics on the day - [express your interest here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16RFTcpEx3EQK9xUUJpuyxSKGPDp_q8ZwbWQzJTpPYyg/edit?usp=sharing).

## London's community for developers and users of Python data tools

Run by volunteers, PyData London provides Python enthusiasts a place to share ideas and learn from each other about how best to apply the language and tools to ever-evolving challenges in the vast realm of data management, processing, analytics and visualisation. We run **monthly events on the first Tuesday of each month**, in addition to **annual conferences**. We aim to provide a venue for users across all the various domains of data analysis to share their experiences and their techniques, as well as highlight the triumphs and potential pitfalls of using Python. 

Sign up to our next event on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/) and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pydatalondon/) for the latest news!

PyData is organised by [NumFOCUS.org](http://www.numfocus.org/), a non-profit organisation which supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source scientific software.
